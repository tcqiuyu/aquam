                    <p>
                        Water Management is an enormous operation when you consider each and every significant phase
                        involved in an upstream process. There is input, output, treatment, and reuse which can all
                        be done more crucially with an ever helpful oversight. This way the wastes involved, costs
                        involved and the footprint can be reduced even more. The graphic below explains why and what
                        our solution provides the operator with.

                            based on historical data, giving the user a temporal edge of analyzing how much water was
                            produced over a specific amount of time, and how the user could imperatively plan the amount
                            of water to be handled on a particular day. It has been strategically designed to estimate
                            time based production of water based on trends fitted to the well known Arp's Equation for
                            modeling produced water. Not only does it calculate the water to be produced on a particular
                            day, it also seamless integrates the numbers to estimate average water production volumes
                            for a particular time frame, as specified by the user.
