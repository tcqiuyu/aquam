                    Water Management is an enormous operation when you consider each and every significant phase 
                    involved in an upstream process. There is input, output, treatment, and reuse which can all 
                    be done more crucially with an ever helpful oversight. This way the wastes involved, costs 
                    involved and the footprint can be reduced even more. The graphic below explains why and what 
                    our solution provides the operator with.

                        The Water Use modeler is an interactive  tool designed to fit the user, in this case, an operator 
                        or a water management company to anlayze their statistics of water, current and historical to establish 
                        a baseline and a trend to improve their water use scenarios significantly. This tool also provides the 
                        user to look at Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as average horizontal length drilled, average 
                        water used per well and bbls water used per horizontal foot, on an annual comparison basis.

                        Water Quality is a paramount part of estimating the pertinent treatment required to reuse the produced water 
                        to a beneficial reuse condition. This modeler will estimate the quality of the water being produced, 
                        simultaneously addressing the temporal aspects of the changing water quality. In laymen terms, this 
                        tool helps estimate the incoming water quality of produced water with respect to time, in order to plan 
                        effective treatment. It models the water quality based on historical averages of water quality for any 
                        specific dataset.

                        The Produced Water Modeler is an interactive tool designed to model water production trends 
                        based on historical data, giving the user a temporal edge of analyzing how much water was 
                        produced over a specific amount of time, and how the user could imperatively plan the amount 
                        of water to be handled on a particular day. It has been strategically designed to estimate 
                        time based production of water based on trends fitted to the well known Arp's Equation for 
                        modeling produced water.  Not only does it calculate the water to be produced on a particular 
                        day, it also seamless integrates the numbers to estimate  average water production volumes 
                        for a particular time frame, as specified by the user.
