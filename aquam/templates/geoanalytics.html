	                    This modeler is an interactive tool designed to model water production trends based on historical data,
	                    giving the user a temporal edge of analyzing how much water was produced over a specific amount of time,
	                    and how the user could imperatively plan the amount of water to be handled on a particular day. It has
	                    been strategically designed to estimate time based production of water based on trends fitted to the well
	                    known Arp's Equation for modeling produced water.  Not only does it calculate the water to be produced
	                    on a particular day, it also seamless integrates the numbers to estimate  average water production volumes
	                    for a particular time frame, as specified by the user.

	                    This analyzer is an interactive tool designed to fit the user, in this case,
						an operator or a water management company to anlayze their statistics of water,
						current and historical to establish a baseline and a trend to improve their water
						use scenarios significantly. This tool also provides the user to look at
						Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as average horizontal length drilled,
						average water used per well and bbls water used per horizontal foot,
						on an annual comparison basis.
