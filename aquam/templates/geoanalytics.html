                    AQUAM provides users with a unique set of tools to optimize different segments of fluids
                    management in the shale oil and gas industry. These tools were developed in accordance
                    with current industry operations as part of a project jointly funded by the U.S Department
                    of Energy and Noble Energy as part of the Research Partnership to Secure Energy for America.

	                    This modeler is an interactive tool designed to model water production trends based on historical data,
	                    giving the user a temporal edge of analyzing how much water was produced over a specific amount of time,
	                    and how the user could imperatively plan the amount of water to be handled on a particular day. It has
	                    been strategically designed to estimate time based production of water based on trends fitted to the well
	                    known Arp's Equation for modeling produced water.  Not only does it calculate the water to be produced
	                    on a particular day, it also seamless integrates the numbers to estimate  average water production volumes
	                    for a particular time frame, as specified by the user.
